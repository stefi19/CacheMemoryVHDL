cache capacity: 256 bytes
block size: 4 bytes
number of cache lines: 64
mapping policy: direct-mapped
write policy: write through

=> tag, index, offset
tag = 8 
index = 6 bits (select one of the 64 cache lines)
offset = 2 bits (select one byte from the block)

FSM: 
- Search (check available info; if not found - miss and go to update, else go to RD/WR state)
- Update (bring an entire block from the main memory to compensate)
- RD/WR (data is read from or written to cache)
